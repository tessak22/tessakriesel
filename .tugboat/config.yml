    # Set this as the default service. This does a few things
    #   1. Clones the git repository into the service container

        # You might also use the wp-cli tool to set particular variables like DB_NAME

        # Link the document root to the expected path. Tugboat uses /docroot
        # by default. So, if WordPress is located at any other path in your git
        # repository, change that here. This example links /web to the docroot
        - ln -snf "${TUGBOAT_ROOT}/web" "${DOCROOT}"

      # Commands that import files, databases, or other assets. When an
      # existing preview is refreshed, the build workflow starts here,
      # skipping the init step, because the results of that step will
      # already be present.

        # SSH key found in the Tugboat Repository configuration must be
